# Obsidian Theme (for JetBrains IDEs)

A basic theme trying to keep as close as possible to the [original Eclipse Obsidian theme](http://www.eclipsecolorthemes.org/?view=theme&id=21).

The theme is for [JetBrains IDEs](https://www.jetbrains.com/products.html) i.e. IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm, WebStorm, etc.

The JetBrain's built-in `Darcula` theme is used as fallback for functionality not covered by the original Eclipse Obsidian theme.

## How to use
1. **(Option 1)** Run the `build.sh` script to generate an `Obsidian.jar` file that you can then import into a JetBrains IDE.
    - Import by going to _`File` -> `Import Settings`_.
2. **(Option 2)** Place the `Obsidian.icls` file inside the IDE's `/config/colors` directory.
    - [Locate your IDE's config directory](https://intellij-support.jetbrains.com/hc/en-us/articles/206544519-Directories-used-by-the-IDE-to-store-settings-caches-plugins-and-logs)
      _(ex: `~/.IntelliJIdea2017.1/config/colors`)_.
    - Restart the IDE after changes
